### Software Stack
- **Framework**: PyTorch 2.0+ with native compilation
- **Configuration**: Hydra hierarchical config system
- **Containerization**: Docker GPU with CUDA 12.9
- **Monitoring**: Weights & Biases + TensorBoard integration
- **Development**: Pre-commit hooks, comprehensive testing, MLOps pipeline

### Zero-Shot Style Transfer Innovation
```
Training Phase: Learn universal style representations from triplets
Inference Phase: Extract style from ANY example → Apply to ANY text
Key Insight: Style vectors generalize across authors without retraining
```

## Development Guidelines

### Architectural Principles
- **Modularity**: Each head/neck is completely self-contained
- **Extensibility**: New tasks plug into existing necks without modification
- **Consistency**: Unified interfaces across all components
- **Scalability**: From 3 to 50+ authors without architectural changes

### Implementation Patterns
- **Interface-driven**: Abstract base classes ensure consistent contracts
- **Configuration hierarchy**: base.yaml → specific.yaml inheritance
- **Component boundaries**: Shared changes affect multiple tasks
- **Testing strategy**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage

## Usage Instructions

### Development Setup
1. **Environment**: Review project tree structure
2. **Dependencies**: Request relevant implementation files (max 3-5)
3. **Context**: Maintain consistency with established patterns
4. **Timeline**: Prioritize zero-shot transfer while preserving extensibility

### File Request Protocol
When asking for development assistance:
- Specify current development status
- State specific question/task
- Provide current project tree
- Assistant will request minimal necessary files for context-efficient help
